# Simple Tasks
##### Now available on the Google Play Store!
### App Description
SimpleTasks is a basic to-do list app for Android programmed in C#, and designed with Google's Material Design in mind. It allows users to add a task to a list, view the task,
and remove the task when it is complete.


### Why is this useful?
If you have a busy schedule and have many things to do in a day, this simple app is perfect. Sure, you can use Google's built in Tasks app if you need complex functionality, but if you just want a easy to use and simple to-do list, this app is perfect for you.


### Plans
Simple Tasks will gradually have features added to it. As of now, the app is very basic, but in the future, I plan to add some new and cool features to the app.


#### C# Android programmers are encouraged to contribute.
